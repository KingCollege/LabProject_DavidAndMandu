By David Mahgerefteh and Mandu Shi

Please note that this submission only pertains to Mandu Shi and David Mahgerefteh. We were instructed to submit a separate repository from the rest of our team as they have not produced anything. Dr Jeroen Keppens told us he would deal with this as a special case when marking. Mandu Shi and David Mahgerefteh' marks are based on this submission.

Thank you.
